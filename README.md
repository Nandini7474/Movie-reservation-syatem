# Movie-reservation-system
This is a full stack web app for a movie theatre ticket booking system. The project began as a MENG course project but I have updated the app with further functionality for gnraphical movie and seat selection.

The application follows client-server design with communication using REST apis. The backend is built with Express on Node.js, front end is built with React, and the database is using MySQL.

Specifically I completed all payment funcitonality (frontend, backend, relational database), as well as back end ticket functionality and front end profile page. I have also refactored the front end to improve the movie selection process including adding graphical displays and selections for movie, showtime, and seat selection.
